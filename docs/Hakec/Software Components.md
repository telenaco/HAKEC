The software component of our haptic feedback framework comprises two main areas: Calibration Scripts and DAQ System Firmware.

[[Calibration Scripts]] are utilized alongside a series of procedures for calibrating single-axis load cells, three-axis load cells, and six-axis load cells. This process includes the application of noise compensation and calibration techniques to enhance sensor accuracy.

On the other hand, the [[DAQ System Firmware]] caters to the data acquisition system's requirements. This firmware facilitates the capture and computation of signals from up to 12 channels, depending on the sensor configuration utilized.

This two-pronged software approach ensures accurate sensor readings and efficient data processing, crucial for the effective characterization of haptic devices.
