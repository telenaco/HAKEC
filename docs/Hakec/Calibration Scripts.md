The cornerstone of our framework is accurate measurement, which is made possible through the calibration scripts we've developed. These scripts compensate for noise and derive an equation for reading data from the load cells. Before diving into calibration, however, it's crucial to understand the operational principle of load cells, which is based on the Wheatstone bridge.

The Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. The Wheatstone bridge configuration is effective for accurate measurements, and in load cells, it allows the conversion of a mechanical force into a measurable electrical output.

Now, the calibration process itself is categorized into three sections according to the type of load cell and full details of the scripts can be found on each of the three aproaches presented: [[single-axis calibration script]], [[three-axis calibration script]], and [[six-axis calibration script]]. Each of these categories has a specific set of calibration procedures, which involve applying known weights and measuring the corresponding load cell response. The subsequent analysis results in calibration factors that transform raw load cell data into meaningful force and torque readings.

Let's delve deeper into the nuances of these calibration processes, exploring each one's unique aspects and the shared goal of facilitating precise and reliable haptic feedback measurements.
