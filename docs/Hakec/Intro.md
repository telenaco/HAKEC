We believe that by making haptic technology more accessible, we can democratize this field, enabling individuals with varying resources and expertise to engage with and contribute to haptic innovation. This framework is designed not only to facilitate the evaluation and characterization of haptic devices but also to enable comparative studies across various modalities. This is a meticulously designed and implemented system that strives to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. It empowers users and developers to create, implement, and study the dynamic realm of kinestetic feedback.

Welcome to the Haptic and Kinesthetic Evaluation and Characterization (HAKEC) framework. This comprehensive resource is designed to address the long-standing need for standardization and accessibility in haptic device evaluation and characterization, offering clear and practical guidance to practitioners and researchers alike. 

Underpinned by extensive research and a broad literature review, the HAKEC framework provides detailed step-by-step instructions for selecting appropriate hardware and software, as well as identifying comparable features and properties for the evaluation of different haptic controllers. All this information is made freely available and is accessible on this website and our [github repository](https://www.google.com/)

The framework comprises three main sections: hardware components, software solutions, and procedural guidelines.

The hardware section dives into the physical elements involved in creating the feedback. We will present a detailed comparison of various load cells used for force measurement, including single-axis, three-axis, and six-axis load cells. These components serve as the backbone of the haptic feedback system, and our framework offers an in-depth understanding of their function and application.

To complete the hardware setup, we will detail how these load cells integrate with the Data Acquisition (DAQ) system and the extension 9-channel shield. The DAQ system plays a critical role in digitizing the analog signals from the load cells and facilitating their interpretation and utilization by a computer.

## [[Software Components]]

The software component of our framework is the digital counterpart of the hardware setup. It includes the DAQ framework that processes and transmits the data from the load cells to the computer. Furthermore, we have designed an efficient PC interface for real-time data capture and processing.

Crucially, the software component also features calibration scripts for single-axis, three-axis, and six-axis calibration. These scripts are essential for ensuring the precision and accuracy of the feedback system, accounting for the various physical parameters that might affect the signal.

## [[Procedure]]

The procedure section aims to provide a more narrative perspective on how these components come together to form a cohesive system. It covers essential topics such as mounting the sensor, capturing and interpreting data, filtering out noise, understanding the use of force and torque data, pinning, oversampling, and more.

This section serves as a comprehensive guide on what variables to measure and what they mean, thereby equipping you with the practical knowledge required to use this framework effectively.
